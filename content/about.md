# About Us
## Our Mission
Artificial intelligence is an exciting and growing field which technology is heading in. Large tech companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft are increasing their involvement in sub fields of AI including machine learning and deep learning. Through the resources and courses on this website, we hope that anyone interested in learning artificial intelligence can get hands-on interaction with training models while also understanding the concepts behind machine learning. 

It's often common that machine learning courses often focus either on the pure mathematical concepts or dive straight into code without much explanation with how the model works. Our courses are made to be self-taught with each lesson building on concepts taught in the previous lessons. Each lesson allows participants to run their own program and see how models are trained for themselves while also understanding how the models work.
