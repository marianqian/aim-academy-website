The Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning Using fast.ai course below consists of seven lessons, each with a pdf lecture and Google Colaboratory notebook which acts as an interactive activity and practice for students to try out training machine learning models. The course is structured to be self-taught and that no background knowledge is required to begin. The course uses the Python deep learning framework fast.ai to build models such as simple neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. The lessons also go over the basics of Python programming, and NumPy and PyTorch libraries. An overview of the course is given below. 

Lesson 1: Introduction to Python and Basics to Machine Learning

Lesson 2: Using NumPy and Introduction to Deep Learning

Lesson 3: Using PyTorch and NumPy for Neural Networks and Gradient Descent and GPUs

Lesson 4: Processing Data Using fast.ai and Hyperparameters and Optimizers

Lesson 5: Train and Finetune Models using fast.ai and Convolutional Neural Networks

Lesson 6: Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks with fast.ai and Recurrent Neural Networks

Lesson 7: Implementing Recurrent Neural Networks with fast.ai (still in development)

Additional to these lessons, we are holding free classes over Google Meet which correspond with each lesson and walk through the details of the notebooks and concepts in the lectures while also providing activities and assignments. These lessons will be held from June 27th to August 1st every Saturday at 10:00 AM to 10:45 AM. Registration deadline was June 20th, but if you would still like to join the class, join our mailing list below, indicate your interest in the additional information section, and we'll get you all caught up. We look forward to working with you!
